# Car-Speed-Detection-using-YOLOv8

This project involves the development and deployment of a car speed detection model using YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm. This model is capable of accurately detecting and tracking vehicles in real-time from video footage. By leveraging the power of deep learning, we have trained the model to not only detect vehicles but also estimate their speeds in the frames.

I have  deployed this model on a web server, allowing users to access the speed detection functionality through a user-friendly interface. This project aims to enhance road safety by providing authorities and stakeholders with a tool to monitor and enforce speed limits effectively. Additionally, it can be utilized for traffic management and analysis purposes, aiding in decision-making processes related to road infrastructure and transportation planning. 
In The future i will improve this project. To the Next level.


## Here are the step-by-step instructions for running the code:

### 1- Install requirements.txt:
To run this code type the given command in the terminal: pip install -q requirements.txt

## 2- Navigate to the Code Directory:
Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where your code is located. For example: cd path/to/your/code/directory

## 3- Download yolov8 weights:
Download yolov8 weigths and place in your Flask app code directory.

## 5- Run the Python Script:
Once you're in the directory containing your ClientApp.py file, run the following command: python ClientApp.py

Following these steps should launch your Flask web application, allowing you to access it through a web browser or any other HTTP client.
