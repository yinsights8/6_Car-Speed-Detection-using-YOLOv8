# Car-Speed-Detection-using-YOLOv8

This project involves the development and deployment of a car speed detection model using YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm. This model is capable of accurately detecting and tracking vehicles in real-time from video footage. By leveraging the power of deep learning, we have trained the model to not only detect vehicles but also estimate their speeds in the frames.

I have  deployed this model on a web server, allowing users to access the speed detection functionality through a user-friendly interface. This project aims to enhance road safety by providing authorities and stakeholders with a tool to monitor and enforce speed limits effectively. Additionally, it can be utilized for traffic management and analysis purposes, aiding in decision-making processes related to road infrastructure and transportation planning.
